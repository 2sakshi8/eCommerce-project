E-Commerce Database Management System

This repository presents a well-structured E-Commerce Database Management System built using MySQL, designed to model real-world online retail operations. The project focuses on clean relational design, data integrity, and meaningful data retrieval through optimized SQL queries.

Overview

The database schema efficiently represents key e-commerce entities including customers, products, orders, order items, and payments. Relationships are enforced using primary keys and foreign keys, ensuring consistency and reliability across transactional data.

Core Components

Customers – Stores customer profiles and location details

Products – Manages product catalog, categories, pricing, and inventory

Orders – Tracks customer orders with status and total amount

Order Items – Handles item-level order details and quantities

Payments – Records payment methods, dates, and transaction status

Highlights

Normalized relational schema following database design best practices

Use of ENUMs for order and payment statuses to maintain controlled values

Realistic sample data for practical querying and analysis

Advanced multi-table JOIN query to generate comprehensive order reports

Clear separation of concerns between transactional and master data

Technologies

MySQL

SQL (DDL, DML, Joins, Constraints)

Applications

Academic and learning projects

SQL and database design practice

Backend database foundation for web or mobile applications

Portfolio project for data, backend, or database roles

This project provides a strong base for future enhancements such as indexing, stored procedures, analytics queries, performance optimization, or integration with application frameworks.
